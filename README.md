My most recent work is my <a href="https://github.com/kngreer1/NCTravel">NCTravel</a> application. It is an ASP.NET MVC application that you can use to view and search activites in North Carolina.

The class projects all have similar functionality. You can view a list of products and see their details. You can select a category from a list to view the products in that category. You can select from a list of states to view the customers in that state. There is home page with links to the rest of the pages. The front-end of the MVC, WebAPI, and NCTravel projects where build with Bootstap.

I am currently taking a class on hybrid mobile development and will be making a project similar to the other class projects. We are using Angular 2, Ionic UI, and Cordova.
